<h1># Project_1</h1>
<span>An app that displays random famous quotes each time a button is clicked.</span>

<p>Using the growing knowledge of basic JavaScript syntax, variables, loops, conditionals and object literals to complete this project.</p>
<div>
<p>To help me get started, TeamTreehouse(https://teamtreehouse.com/projects/a-random-quote-generator) have supplied with some basic starter files, including the HTML, CSS, and a JavaScript file containing some starter code and comments. Then I'll have to:</p>
<li>Locate and select my own quotes.</li>
<li>Build the array of quote objects to store the quotes.</li>
<li>Write my own functions for selecting random quotes from the array and printing them to the screen.</li>
</div>

<span>This project is a fun and effective way to practice basic JavaScript skills.</span>
